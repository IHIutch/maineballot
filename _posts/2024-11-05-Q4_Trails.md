## The gist
This resolution would allow the state to borrow $30 million to fund the Maine Trails Program. This program would design, develop, and maintain trails in the state. It would unlock matching funds of at least $3 million.[^3]

## Ballot question
An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Promote the Design, Development and Maintenance of Trails for Outdoor Recreation and Active Transportation, Do you favor a $30,000,000 bond issue to invest in the design, development and maintenance for nonmotorized, motorized and multi-use trails statewide, to be matched by at least $3,000,000 in private and public contributions?[^3]

{% include yes-no-table.html %}


## Tell me more
* Eligible trails include public use trails that are nonmotorized (25% of funds, motorized (25% of funds), or multi-use (50% of funds) throughout the state.[^3]
* Grants will be awarded competitively to municipalities, the state government, or nonprofits.[^3]
* Sustainable, accessible, or inclusively designed projects will be prioritized.[^3]
* Projects must have 10% matching funds and be supported by a municipality, state agency, nonprofit, trail user program, business, or the public.[^3]

This is a **bond issue** – if voters approve the bond, it means that the State of Maine is allowed to borrow money for the project described in the ballot question and has to pay it back over 10 years. [Learn more about how bonds work](https://www.maineballot.org/bonds).

## Results
This measure passed.

## The gist
This referendum would expand Medicaid coverage in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.

## Ballot question
“Do you want Maine to expand Medicaid to provide healthcare coverage for qualified adults under age 65 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 means $16,643 for a single person and $22,412 for a family of two?”[^3]

{% include yes-no-table.html %}


## Tell me more
For families with children or a disability this referendum would increase the threshold from 100% ($33,948 for a family of 4) of the federal poverty level to 138% ($46,848 for a family of 4) of the federal poverty level.  A second part to this would be that adults with family incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level who do not have dependent children and are not “disabled” would now also qualify.

## Follow the money
### The money will be used to:
* Pay for health insurance[^3]

### The money will be coming from:
* State General Fund appropriations $54.5 million per year[^3]
* Federal funds of $525 million per year[^3]

## Pros
The primary arguments for this referendum are:

* More people (estimated at 70,000) will have health insurance[^3]
* Estimated $27 million annual cost savings[^3]
* Estimated 3,000 new jobs[^3]
* It makes the state eligible for federal Affordable Care Act funds that would cover 94% of the cost in 2018 and 2019 and 90% of the cost in 2020 and later years[^1]

## Cons
The primary arguments against this referendum are:
* It's unclear where the additional $54.5 million in state funds will comes from[^3]

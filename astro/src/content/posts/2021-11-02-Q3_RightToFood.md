## The gist
This resolution would give citizens the explicit right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume their own food.

## Ballot question
"Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to declare that all individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being?"[^1]

{% include yes-no-table.html %}


## Tell me more
This measure would allow individuals to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume food as long as they are not trespassing on somebody else's property or stealing.  It would also ensure individuals have the right to save and exchange seeds.

This question is a **constitutional resolution**, which, if passed, would make a change to the state constitution.

## Follow the money
There's no money directly involved with this referendum.

## Pros
The primary arguments for this referendum are:
* It would give individuals an explicit right to feed themselves.[^3]
* It wouldn't allow individuals to trespass on or steal other people's property.[^3]
* It would allow individuals to save and exchange seeds.[^3]

## Cons
The primary arguments against this referendum are:
* It could infringe on seed patents.[^3]
* Some believe the language is too vague.[^3]
* It could allow people to sidestep existing regulations related to things like animal welfare, pollution, local ordinances, or public safety.[^3]

<h3>Tracking your ballot</h3>
<p>To track the progress of your absentee ballot, utilize the <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/ballot_status.pl">Online Absentee Ballot Request Service</a> page. The ballot tracking system will show you the date that your absentee ballot application is accepted by your municipal clerk, the date your clerk issues (mails out) your ballot to you, and the date your clerk receives your ballot. Please note that the tracker is not updated instantaneously; the information is accessible to you after your municipal clerk enters the updates. You can use this tracking system regardless of how you initially request your absentee ballot (whether you request it directly with your municipal clerk or using the online service). If you have any concerns about your ballot, please contact your municipal clerk directly.</p>

## The gist

This constitutional amendment would remove the requirement for people circulating petitions to be Maine residents who are registered to vote.

## Ballot question

Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to remove a provision requiring a circulator of a citizen's initiative or people's veto petition to be a resident of Maine and a registered voter in Maine, requirements that have been ruled unconstitutional in federal court?[^1]

<YesNoTable yesContent={frontmatter.yes_vote} noContent={frontmatter.no_vote} />

## Tell me more

Currently the Maine Constitution requires anyone collecting signatures for People’s Veto and Direct Initiative petitions to be a resident and registered voter in Maine. This resolution would remove the requirement and align Maine’s constitution with federal law.

Federal courts have already ruled that the residency requirement for petitioners is unconstitutional and can’t be enforced by the state of Maine.[^3]

This question is a **constitutional amendment**, which, if passed, would make a change to the state constitution.

## Follow the money

## Results
This measure passed.

## The gist
This resolution would allow Maine to borrow $25 million for research and development at the Maine Technology Institute. The research would be in the fields of life sciences and biomedical technology, environmental and renewable energy technology, information technology, advanced technologies for forestry and agriculture, aquaculture and marine technology, composites and advanced materials and precision manufacturing. Maine Technology Institute would award the funds to Maine-based businesses through a competitive process and unlock matching funds.[^3]

## Ballot question

## Tell me more
The [Maine Technology Institute](https://www.mainetechnology.org/) is a state-funded nonprofit that supports innovation.[^4]

Award of the funds would be competitive and contingent on a match from federal or private funds on at least a one-to-one basis.[^3]

This is a **bond issue** – if voters approve the bond, it means that the State of Maine is allowed to borrow money for the project described in the ballot question and has to pay it back over 10 years. [Learn more about how bonds work](https://www.maineballot.org/bonds).

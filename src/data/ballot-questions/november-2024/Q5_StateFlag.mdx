## Results
This measure did not pass.

## The gist
This measure would restore a [version of the old Pine Tree Flag](https://www.maine.gov/sos/news/2024/Winner%20-%20Maine%20State%20Flag%20Redesign%20Contest.pdf) that was selected as part of a [contest](https://www.maine.gov/sos/news/2024/FlagContestWinningDesignUnveiled.html).[^4]

## Ballot question
An Act to Restore the Former State of Maine Flag, Do you favor making the former state flag, replaced as the official flag of the State in 1909 and commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, the official flag of the State?[^4]

<YesNoTable yesContent={frontmatter.yes_vote} noContent={frontmatter.no_vote} />

## Tell me more
People have been flying unofficial versions of the Pine Tree Flag for years. This would make it the official flag. In 2023, the state legislature passed legislation allowing this referendum question to see whether citizens want the new flag.[^6]

## Follow the money
The costs to change flags would be absorbed into existing budgets.[^4]

## Pros
The primary arguments for this referendum are:
- The Pine Tree Flag is simpler and more recognizable than the current flag.
- Maine is the pine tree state, so the new flag would reflect that.

## Cons
The primary arguments against this referendum are:
- Some think the Pine Tree Flag design looks amateurish.
- The new design doesn't include as many aspects of Maine's history, such as farming and fishing, as the old one does. [^5]

## Who cares
There is no registered support or opposition to this measure.

<h3 class="archive__subtitle">COVID-19 update</h3>

<p>Anyone registered to vote in Maine can vote by mail by <a href="https://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/index.pl">requesting an absentee ballot</a>. Ballots will be available about one month prior to the election, and you do not need to provide a reason for the request. You can also pick up a ballot at your <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html"> municipal clerk's office</a> or you can request one by mail (<a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/pdf/absballot1120.pdf">PDF request form</a>, <a href ="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/docs/absballot1120.doc">Word request form</a>) or by calling your town clerk's office. <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/voter-info/absenteeguide.html">More information about absentee voting</a>.</p>

<p>After you fill out your ballot, you can send it back in the mail (it's recommended to send it in at least 15 days before the election due to USPS delays) or you can take it to your <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html"> municipal clerk's office.</a></p>

<p>You can also vote in-person early at your <a href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/munic.html"> municipal clerk's office</a>.
